===========
These are examples very basic examples using flutter.  Note, I'm in the process of updating them the new versions.  some may not even compile. 

`bottomnavigationdemo` sets the basics to get the bottom navigation working.

`dialog_Demo` is an example of several dialog boxes.

`draw_Demo` show customPaint, gestureDectector, bottomnavigationbar, with dialogs and colorpicker dialog.

`fab_demo` is simple statefulwidget example of using a floating action button and changing text.  some attempt at changing the theme as well.

`flutter_mapdemo` brings up google maps in flutter and show how to place a couple of markers.

`form_example` is an attempt to redo the formexample in [formexample in basic](https://github.com/JimSeker/ui/tree/master/Basic)

`httpdemo` is the basic example that flutter demos network with.

`speech_demo` uses two plugins, flutter_tts for text to speech, and speech_to_text for speech to text recognization.   this is a very basic demo, but shows how both work.

`sqlitedb_demo` uses sqflite (sqlite) to rework the database example [sqliteDBDemo in saveData Repo](https://github.com/JimSeker/saveData)  (note fails on web, can't store db in a browser I guess).

`take_pic_demo` show how to get picture from the gallery or camera and display it. 

`tcp_demo` Shows how to use a socket and serversocket.  setups a simple connection, and then allows the user to send and receiver messages.  If run on two different phones/emulators the app can talk to each other.  Uses a bottomnavigationbar to setup 2 separate "widgets" one for the server, the other for a client.
